I majorly fucked up my branches and I don't have time to fix them, so I've had to delete the repo and recreate it. Releases are still available through gradle: add `compile com.matthew-tamlin:sliding-intro-screen:1.2.0` to your gradle build file. I've got a heap of fixes that I wanted to release so I hope the have the repo up shortly.
